# JS Async

## Call Stack

the mechanism that JS uses to keep track of where it is in a bunch of function calls (sort of a bookmark)

## JS = Single Threaded

At any given point of time, JS is running at most **one** line of code

```jsx
console.log("start");
setTimeout(() => console.log("waiting..."));
console.log("end");
```

```jsx
// start
// end
// waiting...
```

> JS hands the task to the browser(web API) to do it than JS take it over again

## Callback Hell

when using callbacks for requests we have two options - success or failure. And then, we have two options again when we fail(fxxking **asynchronous!**). And again and again and again (using `.then` , `.catch`). To do this more efficiently, we use promise. **Avoid Nesting!**

## Promise

```jsx
new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
	
})
```

the parameters of this is actually a function that we can execute at any point inside of this promise

## Async Keywords

`async` : use to declare async functions - makes the function return **promise**
if the function returns a value, the promise will be resolved with that value
if the function throws a exception, the promise will be rejected

```jsx
const login = async (username, password) => {
	if(!username || !password) throw 'Missing Credentials'; // Promise.rejected()
	if(password === 467823) return 'Vaild User'; // Promise.resolved()
	throw 'Invalid User';
}
```

`await` : can only use inside of functions declared with `async` (?)
it pauses the execution of the function, waiting for a **promise to be resolved**
